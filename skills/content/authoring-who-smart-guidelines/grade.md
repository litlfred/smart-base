  GRADE — the grading system a WHO guideline folio declares for certainty of
  evidence, and the Evidence-to-Decision judgement a recommendation rests on.
  Read when a folio's `Task_AppraiseGrade` runs under GRADE, before recording a
  certainty, an EtD judgement or a recommendation's direction and strength.

`evidence-appraisal` is the procedure and deliberately names no system — which
one applies is the folio's commitment. This is one system a WHO folio can
declare. It applies to certainty of evidence for a **health recommendation**,
over a body of evidence answering one PICO question — not to platform or
architecture decisions, which are `kepner-tregoe`, recorded per `madr`.

**Every value below is a code, and the codes are nodes.** Each vocabulary is a
`folio-code-list/v1` in `cat-harness/code-lists/`, with a definition and a
source per code, published as SKOS beside the glossary. Record a code, never a
paraphrase of one:

| list | codes |
|---|---|
| `grade-certainty` | `high` · `moderate` · `low` · `very-low` |
| `grade-rating-down` | `risk-of-bias` · `inconsistency` · `indirectness` · `imprecision` · `publication-bias` |
| `grade-rating-up` | `large-effect` · `dose-response` · `plausible-confounding` |
| `grade-etd-criterion` | the twelve Evidence-to-Decision criteria |
| `grade-recommendation-direction` | `for` · `against` |
| `grade-recommendation-strength` | `strong` · `conditional` |

*Moved 2026-09-24 (bean `wg7r`) from `smart-kg/methodologies/grade.md`. The
owner: "needs to be part of skill/SKOS etc. … dont want smart-kg here yet, that
is its own repo already". The method is unchanged; its enumerations became code
lists, so a recorded grade is a code with a definition rather than a string.*

## It has a slot waiting

`processes/evidence-retrieval.bpmn` frames the question as PICO, retrieves
candidates across three classes, and runs `Task_AppraiseGrade` — *"Certainty of
evidence per the grading system the folio declares. The grade attaches to the
BODY of evidence for one PICO question, not to an individual citation."* The
slot stays pluggable, and that is the point: GRADE fills it when declared, and
nothing in the diagram names it.

## Certainty, in four levels

**High · Moderate · Low · Very low** — the certainty that the true effect lies
close to the estimate. Randomised trials start High and observational evidence
starts Low; then:

- **rated down** for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision,
  publication bias;
- **rated up** for a large effect, a dose-response gradient, or where plausible
  confounding would have reduced an observed effect.

**The grade attaches to the body of evidence per outcome, never to a citation.**
A single paper does not have a GRADE. The BPMN task already encodes this by
sitting after the join rather than inside the fan-out, and it is the distinction
most often got wrong. Record every rating-down and rating-up with the code that
moved it — a certainty with no reasons cannot be re-examined.

## Evidence-to-Decision: certainty is one criterion of several

A recommendation does not follow from certainty alone. The EtD framework for
clinical and public-health recommendations judges each criterion explicitly:
problem priority · desirable effects · undesirable effects · certainty of
evidence · values · balance of effects · resources required · certainty of the
evidence of required resources · cost-effectiveness · equity · acceptability ·
feasibility. (The file this replaced listed ten, omitting the two resource
criteria; the code list follows Alonso-Coello et al. 2016.)

Then a recommendation carries a **direction** (for / against) and a **strength**
(strong / conditional). **Strength is not certainty.** A strong recommendation
can rest on low-certainty evidence when the balance of effects is decisive, and
a conditional one can rest on high certainty when values differ across
populations. Conflating the two is the most common misreading of GRADE, and the
reason they are two code lists rather than one score.

## What this platform must not do with it

- **No numeric aggregation of EtD criteria.** The framework judges each
  criterion and argues the recommendation; it does not sum them. A weighted
  total would be the MCDA failure this platform refuses elsewhere — a judgement
  laundered into a measurement.
- **`could not determine` is not `very-low`.** Absent evidence and
  low-certainty evidence are different findings with different actions.
  `evidence-retrieval` models this with `EndEvent_GapRecorded` — *"Gap
  recorded, no recommendation"* — a distinct terminal from an evidence-backed
  one, and `evidence-appraisal` names it a third state.
- **No empirical claim enters a formal proof.** A graded body of evidence
  supports a recommendation, never a theorem. In a paper folio the two live in
  different block kinds and must not be joined.

## Refusals

- **Never grade a single citation.** The body, per outcome.
- **Never report a recommendation without its direction and strength.** One
  without the other is not a GRADE recommendation.
- **Never table it in DMN.** See [`dmn`](../../../../cat-harness/methodologies/dmn.md) — tabling
  asserts a repeatability the method denies.
