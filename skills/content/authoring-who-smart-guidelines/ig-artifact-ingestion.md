Point at a published FHIR Implementation Guide, read what it actually
published, and reconstruct its artefact index as a knowledge graph keyed by the
IG's own canonical URLs — linking each artefact to its JSON, JSON Schema and
JSON-LD representations.

## Which IGs this applies to

**Not all of them.** The test is whether the IG publishes a **DAK API**, and it
is answered by one fact, not by the IG's name or its publisher:

> Are there **enumeration schemas** at the published root — files matching
> `<Type>.schema.json`, such as `ValueSets.schema.json` or
> `LogicalModels.schema.json`?

If yes, `dakApi` is `present` and the overlay is ingested. If the root was read
and held none, it is `absent`. If the root was never read, it is `unknown` —
and **`unknown` is not a kind of `absent`**. "This IG publishes no DAK API" and
"nobody looked" are different facts, and only the first is a reason to stop.

An IG with no DAK API still indexes: the spine is the IG Publisher's own
output, which every IG has. What it loses is the JSON Schema and JSON-LD links,
which is the half worth having — so a no-DAK IG is a thin index, not an error.

## The index is RECONSTRUCTED, never downloaded

The finding that governs everything here, measured 2026-09-21 against
smart-trust v1.8.0:

> **No IG publishes an artefact-index instance document.**

`ValueSets.schema.json` and `LogicalModels.schema.json` sit at the published
**root** — not under `schemas/`, contrary to how `dak-api.html` links them —
and both are JSON *Schemas* describing the shape of an enumeration *response*.
Each carries an `example` block that happens to hold the real list. There is no
`ValueSets.json` to fetch.

So every field in the resulting graph was **assembled**, and the index records
in `provenance` which published file each part came out of. That is required,
not optional: a reader who cannot tell which file a row came from cannot tell a
transcription from an inference.

## THREE DOCUMENT FAMILIES IN ONE DIRECTORY — because there are three SOURCES

`fhir-artifact-index/` holds three kinds of document, and the reason is not
convenience. **Each comes from a different source, so each carries its own
provenance block.** An IG does not publish one thing about itself; it publishes
one thing, keeps a second in its source config, and inherits a third from
packages it merely depends on.

| document | schema | source | what its provenance names |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index.json` | `folio-fhir-artifact-index/v1` | the IG's published **output** (a gh-pages tree) | `{kind: "gh-pages", of, readAt}` |
| `menu.json` | `folio-ig-menu/v1` | the IG's own **`sushi-config.yaml`** | repository + **commit** + path |
| `chrome.json` | `folio-ig-chrome/v1` | the **`fhir.template` chain** its `ig.ini` names | one block **per layer**, each with its own commit |

**Folding any two together would give one file two answers to "where did this
come from".** That is the whole argument, and it is `0818`'s (the menu) and
`ajx9`'s (the chrome) in one sentence.

### The menu is the IG's own ordering of itself

`sushi-config.yaml`'s `menu:` is a nested **map**, and order is the file's
order — alphabetising it would silently re-navigate somebody else's IG. It was
NOT transcribed from a screenshot, and `schemas/ig-menu.ts` records why: a
picture carries no hrefs, and a closed dropdown is indistinguishable from an
empty one. Measured 2026-09-23: the twelve labels visible in that screenshot
matched **0 of 674** artefact titles — the harvest kept the IG's artefacts and
dropped both its navigation and the narrative pages it points at.

### The chrome comes from a CHAIN, and only part of it is the IG's own

An IG declares its appearance in **no file it owns**. Measured 2026-09-23 for
smart-trust:

```
local-template  →  who.template.root 0.5.0  →  fhir.base.template 1.0.0
```

So `chrome.json` carries `layers` base-first, and every token records which
package **won** it and what it **overrode**. That is not bookkeeping: it is the
only way to answer *whose value is this?* Of the three things a reader
recognises as "the WHO IG", **only two are WHO's** — `who.css` styles no
`#publish-box` at all, so the yellow box is HL7's, inherited unchanged. The
token comes out `from: "fhir.base.template"` with `overrides: []`, which is
what proves it rather than asserting it.

**An overlay is not a merge.** `--toc-box-border` is `1px solid navy` in HL7
and `navy` in WHO — each right in its own layer, and together they make HL7's
rule resolve to `border: navy`, which is invalid. Every individual layer
parses, so a naive merge ships a broken rule **silently**.

### Upstream defects are RECORDED, never corrected

A mirror that silently fixes its subject is not a mirror. Two kinds, both found
2026-09-23 and both carried verbatim into our copy:

- **`shape`** — one token name carrying two different KINDS of value across
  layers, as above.
- **`malformed`** — a value that is not valid CSS on its own terms.
  `--breadcrumb-text-color: ##555555` at `project.css:82`, a doubled `#` in
  HL7's source.

The second is in the skill because of how it presents downstream: it appears in
our generated page as `##555555`, **looking exactly like a bug in the ingest
that copied it**. It cost the author of that ingest about thirty seconds of
believing they had written it, with the source open in the next terminal. A
reader without the source open cannot tell at all. So the mirror carries the
value and the record says whose defect it is.

The detector is deliberately **narrow** — one pattern. A false positive accuses
somebody else's published stylesheet of a fault it does not have.

### CI cannot obtain any of these inputs, and the checks say so

All three ingests read something outside this checkout, and the chrome needs
**three** upstream checkouts rather than one. `worldhealthorganization.github.io`
and `litlfred.github.io` both answer 403 CONNECT from this environment.

So `ingest:ig-menu:check` and `ingest:ig-chrome:check` exit **2** with no
source — `could not determine`, never the 0 a silent skip would give — and both
are registered in `gates.ts` as `report` rather than as gates. What IS gated on
every run, without the network: `smart-trust:pages:check` regenerates all 681
pages from the committed data and compares byte for byte, and
`check:kind-validators` parses each file against its schema.

## Four partial views, and none of them is sufficient

Measured on smart-trust v1.8.0. The coverage gaps are the reason the pipeline
merges rather than picking a winner:

| file | entries | holds | misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `canonicals.json` | 70 | canonical URL, version, name | the 604 Endpoints and Organizations |
| `package.tgz` → `package/.index.json` | 674 | every artefact's type and id | titles, categories, canonicals |
| `artifacts.html` | 676 links | the editorial **category** and human title | machine-readable anything |
| `package.manifest.json` | 1 | package id, version, FHIR version, build date | — |

`artifacts.html` is the **only** source of an artefact's category. Its per-row
`title` attribute carries `ResourceType/id` verbatim, which is the index's own
key format — so the category join is on an identifier the publisher wrote, not
one the pipeline composed from a filename.

**Read the source, not the page about the source.** `dak-api.html` is prose
*about* what is published, and on smart-trust it links the enumeration schemas
to a `schemas/` directory they are not in. A pipeline written from the
documentation would have found nothing at the paths it named.

## Two traps

**`openapi/openapi.json` is not the DAK API.** On smart-trust that path holds
the *DDCC Gateway* API — a domain API about certificate exchange that merely
lives there. A pipeline that globs for `openapi` files a piece of subject
matter as an artefact descriptor. The overlay is therefore keyed off **each
artefact's own stem** (`schemas/<ResourceType>-<id>.openapi.json`), never off a
directory scan.

**`.index.json` is lossy.** Its Organization entries on smart-trust carry a
truncated `"type": "["`. Do not repair such a value and do not propagate it:
`canonicals.json` is the spine for anything canonical, and for a resource that
appears only in `.index.json` the field is simply absent. An absent field is a
fact; a repaired one is a guess wearing a fact's clothes.

## What is never invented

`canonical` is **optional** on an artefact, and that is load-bearing. Examples
and instance resources have no canonical URL and are the majority of a large IG
— 604 of smart-trust's 674. Minting one to fill the slot produces an identifier
that resolves to nothing while looking authoritative, which is the failure the
who-iris catalogue refused for `collection/hq-publications` and refuses here
for the same reason.

The same holds for `category`: absent means the IG published no artefact page,
or listed no row for this artefact. It never means "Other" — the IG's own
artefact page **has** a literal `Other` section, and coining a second one would
make the word mean two things in one index.

## Materialisation

Default is **catalogue by reference**, following `who-iris`: the index records
where each artefact is published and holds no bytes. `--materialize-dak` adds
the DAK surface only — on smart-trust, 332K across 71 files, against 7.1M for
the full resource corpus.

Materialised nodes take `purpose: "working"`, never `archival`: they are
regenerable by re-running the ingest against the same source revision, so they
carry none of archival's obligations. `--check` is what proves that claim,
which is what makes the claim admissible.

Each materialised node carries all five gates of
`folio-assistant-core/schemas/materialization.ts`. Two of them —
**`sourceLoss`** and **`copyright`** — are `unknown` for a WHO IG until somebody
establishes otherwise, and leaving them `unknown` is correct rather than lazy:
no statement has been made about how long a given version's Pages build stays
reachable, and the IG's licensing has not been read. A `permitted` there would
be the "no restrictions known in context" failure that `GateVerdict` is
three-valued to prevent.

## `gh-pages` and `output/` are not the same evidence

Both are accepted (`--kind`), and the index records which was read. They are
different claims: `output/` is a **local build** whose contents depend on who
ran the publisher and when, while `gh-pages` is **what the world can see**. An
index built from the first and labelled the second asserts public availability
for artefacts that may never have been published.

Prefer `gh-pages` for anything that will be cited. Use `output/` when checking
an IG you are mid-way through authoring — and expect the index to change when
it is actually published.

## Running it

```sh
bun run ingest:ig -- \
  --source /path/to/gh-pages --kind gh-pages \
  --id smart-trust \
  --base https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/smart-trust \
  --out smart-trust --materialize-dak
```

`--base` is the URL the artefacts are **published at**, and it is not the
canonical base. smart-trust publishes at `worldhealthorganization.github.io`
and is canonical at `smart.who.int` — the index carries both, and composing
either from the other is how a link that resolves for nobody gets written down.
`canonicalBase` is read from the IG's own `ImplementationGuide` canonical, not
derived from `--base`.

`bun run ingest:ig:check` re-runs the ingest and fails if the committed index
differs. That is what makes this graph regenerable rather than a snapshot
nobody can re-derive; `readAt` is excluded from the comparison because it moves
every run by design.

## Adding another IG

1. Clone the IG's `gh-pages` (shallow, single branch — a published IG is large;
   smart-trust's is 342,656 files).
2. Run the ingest with a new `--id` and `--out`.
3. Give the new directory a declaration declaring one directory of kind
   `fhir-artifact-index`, as `smart-trust/smart-trust.config.json` does. The
   declaration is `<name>.config.json` since #695 — resolve it with
   `declarationPathIn`, never by joining a filename.
4. Add its `ingest:ig:check` invocation to the gate set, so the index cannot go
   stale silently.

Step 4 is the one that gets skipped. An index nothing re-derives is a snapshot,
and a stale snapshot of someone else's corpus is worse than no index: it
answers confidently and wrongly about artefacts that have since moved.
