# dak-preprocessing

> Skill id: `dak-preprocessing` · Package: `authoring-who-smart-guidelines` ·
> Layer: **`smart-base`, DAK kind** ([`smart-stack-layering`](smart-stack-layering.md); `smart-dak` until stage D, #1767),

> authoring, not pre-processing".

The phase the WHO build calls *DAK Preprocessing*: everything that runs between
checkout and `publisher.jar`, gated by the `do_dak` input and by the presence of
`dak.json` at the repository root — **upstream's spelling**; ours is
`dak.config.json` since 2026-09-22 and nothing at WHO has been renamed.

> **Sourcing.** Read from `WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base` —

## The steps, and what each one accomplishes

| # | script | what it actually does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `generate_dak_from_sushi.py` | writes `dak.json` from `sushi-config.yaml` plus branch/repo context — only when `smart.who.int.base` is a dependency and `dak.json` is absent |
| 2 | `update_sushi_config.py` | **registers pages and menu entries in `sushi-config.yaml`, and writes placeholder markdown** — see below, this is the one that matters |
| 3 | `generate_dak_from_sushi.py`, again | re-runs step 1 with the resolved branch context, after the branch name has been sanitised |
| 4 | `dmn_questionnaire_generator.py` | emits FHIR `Questionnaire` resources from the DMN decision tables |
| 5 | `transform_dmn.py` + `dmn2html.xslt` + `dmn.css` | renders each DMN file to HTML for inclusion in a page |
| 6 | `inject_translations.py` | substitutes translated strings into the diagram sources before they are rendered |

Six script invocations across four named workflow steps: the first two share the
step *"Prepare DAK environment"*, and step 3 is a deliberate second run.

## What "get it into the IG index" meant — step 2, precisely

This is the step the phase mostly exists for, and it is worth stating exactly,
because the vague version (*"pre-processing gets things into the index so the
pages render"*) is what keeps the phase alive after its reason has gone.

`update_sushi_config.py` does four things:

1. **Scans for resources** — `fsh-generated/resources/` (SUSHI's output) and
   `input/resources/` (static JSON), collecting every `ValueSet` and every
   logical-model `StructureDefinition`.
2. **Writes a placeholder markdown page per resource** into
   `input/pagecontent/`, as `ValueSet-<id>.md` and the logical-model equivalent,
   each carrying a `<!-- DAK_API_PLACEHOLDER: … -->` marker. A file that already
   exists **with real content** is left alone; the marker is how the script
   tells its own placeholder from an author's page.
3. **Registers `dak-api.md` in `sushi-config.yaml`'s `pages:` map**, creating
   the `pages:` key if the IG has none.
4. **Registers `Indices → DAK API → dak-api.html` in the `menu:` map**, creating
   `menu:` and the `Indices` subsection if absent.

So the "index" is **`sushi-config.yaml`'s `pages:` and `menu:` maps**, and the
"pages would not render" is literal: the IG Publisher's Jekyll renders a page
only if the file exists in `input/pagecontent/` **and** the config's `pages:`
names it. Both halves are what step 2 supplies.

**Which is why this step does not survive the transition.** Under the
just-the-docs pipeline the navigation is derived from `sushi-config.yaml`
directly and the pages are folio pages — we own both maps, so writing them back
into somebody else's config to get them read again is a round trip through a
tool we are removing. See [`ig-render-jekyll`](../../../../fhir-harness/skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-render-jekyll.md)
for what replaces it, and `kn0t` for the phasing.

## Two of these are authoring, not pre-processing

Steps 4 and 5 — `dmn_questionnaire_generator.py` and `transform_dmn.py` — are
**not** hooks around a renderer. They mint artefacts:

- the questionnaire generator emits **FHIR resources**, which the Publisher then
  validates, indexes and publishes like any other resource. Delete the step and
  the IG is missing `Questionnaire`s, not missing a page.
- the DMN transform produces the **only** human-readable rendering of a decision
  table the IG has.

They run late because the pipeline had nowhere earlier to put them, not because
they depend on anything the Publisher does. **They are content generation and
belong upstream of the Publisher, in the DAK document kind as authoring steps** — which is
how they survive the transition while step 2 does not.

`transform_dmn.py` has a second property worth recording: its output is
**HTML**, which the JSON-only render contract does not take. Either it gains a
structured output, or its HTML is treated as an embedded asset rather than as a
representation. That is an open question, not a settled one — bean `kn0t`.

## Step 6 is conditional on who renders

`inject_translations.py` rewrites diagram sources **before** rendering because
the Publisher offers no later hook. Once pages render through just-the-docs, the
locale layer already in this platform does this, and the step is redundant **for
pages**. It is not redundant for the diagram sources themselves, which are still
rasterised outside Jekyll.

Do not remove it on the strength of the page argument alone.

## Steps 1 and 3 — one fact, computed twice

`generate_dak_from_sushi.py` runs twice, the second time *"with current branch
context"*. That is a workaround for ordering: the branch name is sanitised by a
later step than the one that first needs it.

`dak.config.json` is **ours** (bean `cz17`), not a file we merely read, so this is a
derivation we own and can compute once, in the right order. Do not reproduce the
double run when lifting this step.

## What a QA report already exists for

Every one of these scripts instantiates a `QAReporter` and writes a phase report
— `successes`, `warnings`, `errors`, `files_processed`, `files_expected`,
`files_missing`, plus a summary with counts and a completion timestamp. **The
data for the QA-report graph typology already exists and is thrown away**, because
nothing downstream read it.

**It has somewhere to go now.** The owner ruled for the evidence-led option on
2026-09-22 and `qa-report/v1` is registered — `schemas/qa-report.ts`, graph typology
`qa-report`, `holds: "state"`. The shape is whatever these scripts already emit,
down to upstream's snake_case field names, because renaming them would insert a
translation step between a producer we do not control and a consumer we do.

## Where the counterpart is

[`dak-postprocessing`](dak-postprocessing.md) — the eight steps after the
Publisher run. [`ig-publication`](../../../../fhir-harness/skills/content/fhir-ig-authoring/ig-publication.md) — the Publisher run itself
and the authority to release. [`smart-stack-layering`](smart-stack-layering.md)
— which layer each of these belongs to, and the falsification test that placing
them is what checks the stack.
