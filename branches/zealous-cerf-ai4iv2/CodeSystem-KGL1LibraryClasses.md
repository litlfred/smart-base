Not a recommendation, and not a good practice statement — both are made by a guideline and approved by the GRC; this is neither. It carries no kind, direction, strength or certainty, because nothing graded it. A handbook's own \"Best practices\" lists are the typical source. Owner ruling 1b, 2026-10-12: model these as their own class, not as recommendation nodes of a new kind."
