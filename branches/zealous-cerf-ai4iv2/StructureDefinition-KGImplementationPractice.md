A statement of how to put guidance into practice, printed in a publication whose publicationType is implementation-guidance or methodology: the handbook's "products that are not guidelines" (§1.9), a "how to" document that makes no recommendations of its own. Not a recommendation, and not a good practice statement — both are made by a guideline and approved by the GRC; this is neither. It carries no kind, direction, strength or certainty, because nothing graded it. A handbook's own "Best practices" lists are the typical source. Owner ruling 1b, 2026-10-12: model these as their own class, not as recommendation nodes of a new kind. statement is verbatim and is the only stored copy, as recommendation's is. identifier is used in the IRI. There is no remark: L1 3.0's remark is minted under a recommendation (its iriPattern) and hasRemark starts at one, so a remark of a practice needs L1 itself to change — proposed upstream, not patched here. Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/implementation-practice.
