What kind of publication this is. The distinction that matters most for provenance is guideline versus not: a summary table or position paper restates recommendations made elsewhere, and a §1.9 product makes none of its own. Conflating them makes a citation resolve to the wrong authority. Source: smart-kg ontology/l1/l1.json valueSets "publication-type"; WHO handbook for guideline development (2014), Table 1.2 and §1.7–1.9; the BCG decision table's citation for summary-table; CDHIv2.fsh for classification.
