It records system, code and display, and asserts NOTHING about the terminology: no hierarchy, no subsumption, no synonyms, no post-coordination. The terminology has its own authority, its own release cycle and its own tooling, and a partial copy here would be wrong within one release. Resolve meaning against the terminology server, not against this graph."
