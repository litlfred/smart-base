What sort of normative statement this is. Grading is optional: ANC 2016 prints a direction ('Recommended', 'Not recommended') and no GRADE strength. A strength always needs a direction. A good practice statement and a no-recommendation carry no strength or certainty, and a no-recommendation carries no direction.
