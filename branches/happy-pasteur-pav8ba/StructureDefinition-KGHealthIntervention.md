An intervention identified in a WHO catalogue or classification (UHC Compendium, ICHI, CDHI), digital interventions included. A peer of recommendation, not a recommendation. A DAK may draw on both. Corresponds to HealthInterventions: identifier and description correspond to HealthInterventions.id and description[x]; not a Parent because HealthInterventions requires reference 1..* DublinCore, which here is an edge (definedIn) rather than a field. Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/health-intervention.
