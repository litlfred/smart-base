## Logical Model: Knowledge graph L1: Terminology code 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://smart.who.int/base/StructureDefinition/KGTerminologyCode | *Version*:0.3.0 |
| Active as of 2026-10-07 | *Computable Name*:KGTerminologyCode |

 
A code in an external terminology — ICD-10, ICD-11, SNOMED CT, ATC, or a WHO classification such as CDHI. CROSS-REFERENCE ONLY. It records system, code and display, and asserts NOTHING about the terminology: no hierarchy, no subsumption, no synonyms, no post-coordination. The terminology has its own authority, its own release cycle and its own tooling, and a partial copy here would be wrong within one release. Resolve meaning against the terminology server, not against this graph. Derives from Coding (FHIR R4 core datatype); system, code, display, version are its elements. Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/terminology-code.
