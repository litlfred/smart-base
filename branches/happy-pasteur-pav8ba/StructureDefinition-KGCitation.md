One citation string exactly as written in a DAK artefact. A cell holding several citations yields several nodes. Content-addressed in the DAK's namespace, so one string is one node across artefacts. Where a citation was found is recorded by appearsIn (L2) and by each use edge (L2-DMN, L3 citesSource), not on the node. Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/citation.
