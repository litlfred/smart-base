## Logical Model: Knowledge graph L1-LIBRARY: Library node 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://smart.who.int/base/StructureDefinition/KGLibraryNode | *Version*:0.3.0 |
| Active as of 2026-10-07 | *Computable Name*:KGLibraryNode |

 
A node in the ingested library L1 is read from: a source document, a section or a block, addressed by the library's own IRI. Opaque, as L1 asserts nothing about the library's internal model; the library is upstream, so pointing at it keeps the layering rule. Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/library-node. 

**Usages:**
