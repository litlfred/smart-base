An outcome a guideline group chose to judge a key question by, with its importance in this guideline (handbook §7.6). A node because evidence attaches to it and one list is shared by several questions (ANC Web annex 1). Flat: one node per specific outcome. name as first printed; aliases are the other printed forms (e.g. 'EGWG'); category is the printed group heading (e.g. 'Fetal/newborn morbidity'). Class IRI: http://smart.who.int/kg/outcome.
