## The stack, as the owner ruled it

2026-09-22, verbatim, because the shape **is** the decision:

> `core->fhir-harness-> smart-base->siblings{smart-l1, smart-dak, smart-ig}`,  no smart-guidelines.

```
folio-assistant-core
  └── fhir-harness              bare FHIR IG pipeline — no WHO anything
        └── smart-base          WHO SMART harness rules + data models; instantiates smart.who.int.base
              ├── smart-l1      L1 — narrative assets, the source a DTH is written from
              ├── smart-dak     L2 — the DAK harness every smart-* DAK repo instantiates
              └── smart-ig      L3 — the FHIR IG instantiation of a DAK
```

**The three are siblings, not a chain.** An instance may hold any one without
the others: an L1 corpus with no DAK behind it is a real thing, and so is an IG
with no L1. Chaining them would make every IG declare a dependency on a
narrative corpus it never reads.

## The question that settles placement

One question, asked in this order, first `no` wins:

> **1. Would a non-WHO FHIR IG need this?** → `fhir-harness`.
> **2. Would every WHO SMART asset need it, L1, L2 and L3 alike?** → `smart-base`.
> **3. Otherwise** → whichever of the three siblings owns that knowledge layer.

It is deliberately not "which layer does it feel like". The first question is
answerable by naming one non-WHO IG that would want the thing; if you cannot
name one, the answer is no.

## `no smart-guidelines` is the load-bearing half

Four stack options were offered and **every one of them kept a
`smart-guidelines` layer**, on the reading that WHO SMART policy needed a home
that was not the base IG. The ruling says it does not — `smart-base` is that
home, and it also instantiates its own IG.

So the failure mode to watch for is **re-introducing the layer under another
name**: a `smart-common`, a `smart-core`, a `shared/` skills package that only
the three siblings import. If three siblings need one rule, that rule is
`smart-base`'s. Three siblings agreeing is not evidence that a fourth layer is
missing; it is evidence that the rule was always general.

## What each layer may hold, and what it may not

| layer | holds | must NOT hold |
|---|---|---|
| `fhir-harness` | SUSHI, IG Publisher invocation, Jekyll assembly, publication to a pages branch, the artefact-index reconstruction | any WHO term, `dak.config.json`, any DAK pre/post step, any `smart.who.int` canonical |
| `smart-base` | the SMART harness rules, the DAK logical model, `dak.config.json`'s schema, WHO voices and methodologies, the `smart.who.int.base` IG | subject matter for any one guideline; anything only one sibling needs |
| `smart-l1` | narrative L1 assets, figure narratives, the corpus a DTH is written from | FHIR resources; anything an IG build reads |
| `smart-dak` | L2 — the DAK components, DMN/BPMN authoring, the DAK-shaped pre-processing | FHIR profiles; publication |
| `smart-ig` | L3 — FSH, profiles, terminology binding, the IG build for one guideline | L1 narrative; DAK authoring |

## Two consequences that overturn what is on `main`

**1. There is no per-IG harness.** `smart-trust` is declared a harness instance
today (#690, #717) and `smart-immunizations` carries a declaration whose own
comment calls itself *"PROVISIONAL BY DESIGN"*. Under this stack both are
**instances of `smart-ig`**. Bean `nsbb` had already argued it from the other
direction — *"no `smart-trust` harness, because it adds no new functionality"*.

**2. `fhir-harness` may not import the WHO package.** It is the layer a non-WHO
IG instantiates, and a dependency on `authoring-who-smart-guidelines` would make
that impossible while still passing every gate — nothing would fail, the layer
would simply stop being usable for what it is for. This skill lives in the WHO
package **and describes `fhir-harness`**, which is the right direction: the
upper layer may know the stack, the lower layer may not.

## Where this is going: smart-base becomes a conventional IG

The owner, 2026-09-22: *"want to slowly get smart-base back to a more
conventional IG state w/o tooling"*.

`WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base` currently does two jobs. It **is** an IG
(`smart.who.int.base`, FHIR 4.0.1, its own profiles and logical models), and it
**hosts the toolchain every downstream SMART IG runs** — `ghbuild.yml` is a
reusable workflow, and a downstream build `curl`s its scripts from smart-base's
`main` at build time.

That second job is what ends. Its consequences are worth naming, because each
is a reason rather than a preference:

- **A downstream IG's build depends on a branch it does not control.** Scripts
  are fetched from smart-base `main`, so an IG's build can change without its
  repository changing.
- **The IG and the toolchain version together.** A fix to one is a release of
  the other.
- **The tooling is invisible to the harness.** Scripts in somebody's `input/`
  are not Tool nodes, so no process can bind them and no audit can reach them.

The migration is `smart-base/tools/` in this repository: Tool nodes now,
execution later. **Declaring is not vendoring** — see
[`smart-base-tools`](smart-base-tools.md), whose *"never vendor it"* rule is
about copies of the code and is unchanged.

Scope, stated because it is easy to over-read: this is **pre-work in
`litlfred/*`**. Nothing at `WorldHealthOrganization/*` is being changed, and
the `dak.json` → `dak.config.json` rename is ours alone until upstream follows.

## The falsification test

The split is a claim, and it is checkable:

> **Every step of the existing WHO build assigns to exactly one layer.**

The build is 13 steps of DAK pre- and post-processing around one Publisher run,
read from `WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base`'s `.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml`
(the `do_dak` input gates the pre and post phases). If a step cannot be placed,
or if two siblings both need to own one, **the sibling split is wrong** and this
skill is what should change. The assignment is in
[`dak-preprocessing`](dak-preprocessing.md) and
[`dak-postprocessing`](dak-postprocessing.md); those two skills carry the steps,
this one carries the rule they are placed by.

Do not resolve a conflict by adding a layer. Report it.

### The test has been run, and here is what it returned

**All 26 steps place.** 6 pre-processing, 1 Publisher run, 9 post-processing,
10 deploy. Three of them moved against their own step names, which is the only
outcome that tells you a split is load-bearing rather than descriptive:

| step | labelled | placed |
|---|---|---|
| `strip_library_binaries.py` | DAK Postprocessing | `fhir-harness` |
| `strip_library_content.py` | DAK Postprocessing | `fhir-harness` |
| comment on PR — deployment completed | (deploy) | `cat-harness` |

And the deploy phase as a whole came back **entirely generic** — see
[`ig-build-pipeline`](../../../../fhir-harness/skills/fhir-ig-base/ig-build-pipeline.md)
§"The deploy phase". The overlay does not reach the deployment end at all,
which is the strongest evidence for `nsbb`'s base-plus-overlay claim.

**No step required a sixth layer, and none needed two owners.** The split
survives its own test. Re-run it when a step is added upstream; a test that was
passed once is not a test.

## Where an instance says which layer it is

In its declaration's `needs`, and nowhere else. `needs: ["smart-base"]` is what
makes an instance a sibling; `needs: ["fhir-harness"]` is what makes it a
non-WHO IG. There is no `layer` field and there should not be one — a second
place to state it is a second place for it to be wrong.

Conventions for the declaration itself:
[`directory-conventions`](../../../../cat-harness/skills/kg/kg-core/directory-conventions.md).
