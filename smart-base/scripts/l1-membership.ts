/**
 * Is an ingested document L1 — WHO guideline content the SMART knowledge graph
 * describes — and which kind of publication is it? Bean `mffs`.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-07: *"do all 3 (declared, inferred and decided)"*. The answer
 * is recorded on the intake (`classifications`, `cat-harness/schemas/intake.ts`)
 * from up to three sources and resolved here by precedence:
 *
 * | source | who | smart-kg derivation |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `declared` | a person said so | `decided` (and the evidence names them and the date) |
 * | `context` | the process that acquired it decided, e.g. a DAK's library step fetching what Component 1 cites | `derived` |
 * | `inferred` | {@link inferL1} read it off the Dublin Core record | `inferred` |
 *
 * The highest-precedence record wins; every lower one that disagrees is
 * reported, never dropped. No record at all is `undetermined` — the L1 step
 * then does nothing and says so, rather than treating silence as "no".
 *
 * The scheme, its codes and the inference rule are the content type's, so they
 * live here and not in the platform's intake schema.
 *
 * @module smart-base/scripts/l1-membership
