/**
 * A folio that depends on smart-base, for tests that hold this instance's
 * contributions (DAK block kinds, DAK QA checkers) against the dependency walk
 * that delivers them.
 *
 * ## Why a fixture, and not `smart-ig`
 *
 * A contribution reaches a folio through the folio's dependency tree, and
 * `loadContributions` walks a root's dependencies, never the root itself. So
 * these tests need a root whose tree INCLUDES smart-base. They used
 * `../../smart-ig` — the sibling layer that declared smart-base below it in
 * the monorepo. smart-ig has since been separated to `litlfred/smart-ig` and
 * the index composition skips it, so that path resolves to nothing and the
 * walk found no smart-base at all: every DAK kind, prefix and checker read as
 * unregistered.
 *
 * The fixture is the smallest root with the property, and the same one
 * `folio-assistant-sci/scripts/tests/sci-consumer.ts` uses: a declaration in
 * the system temp directory whose config names smart-base BY PATH. smart-base's
 * own `needs` still resolve as its siblings, wherever it is mounted, so the
 * fixture names no layer above this one.
 *
