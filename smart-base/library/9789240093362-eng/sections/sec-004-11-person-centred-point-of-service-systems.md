A person-centered point of service system (PCPOSS), digital in nature, facilitates the provision and 
delivery of health services to individuals (i.e. persons, clients, patients, health service users) at the 
point of care. 
A PCPOSS includes software capabilities that enable health-
care providers to access, record and update individuals’ 
health information as well as interactively communicate with 
them. The term PCPOSS encompasses various services and 
application types, including:
•	 Decision support systems: digital “tools which combine 
medical information databases and algorithms with patient 
specific data. They are intended to provide healthcare 
professionals and/or users with recommendations for 
diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of 
individual patients” (3).
•	 Community-based information systems: Systems that 
“facilitate data collection and use at the community level. 
These applications are utilized by community-based 
workers who provide health promotion and disease 
prevention activities” (3).
•	 Electronic health record systems: “Secure, online systems 
that hold information about people’s health and clinical 
care and are managed by health workers” (3).
•	 Personal health records: A “record of an individual’s health 
information in a structured digital format for a set of defined 
use cases over which the person has agency” (3).  
Additionally, PCPOSS encompasses some of the following 
digital health interventions (3):
•	 1.1.3 Transmit targeted alerts and reminders to health 
service user(s)
•	 2.1.2 Enrol person(s) for health services/clinical care plan
•	 2.2.1 Longitudinal tracking of a health service user’s health 
status and services 
•	 2.2.2 Manage person-centred structured clinical records
•	 2.2.3 Manage person-centred unstructured clinical records 
(e.g. notes, images, documents)
•	 2.2.4 Routine health indicator data collection and 
management 
•	 2.3.1 Provide prompts and alerts according to protocols
•	 2.3.2 Provide checklists according to protocols
•	 2.3.3 Screen persons by risk or other health status
•	 2.5.2 Communication and performance feedback to health 
workers
•	 2.7.1 Identify persons in need of services
•	 4.1.2 Data storage and aggregation
•	 4.1.3 Data synthesis and visualizations. 
Paper-based systems place a large clerical burden on the 
health system and health workers, such as duplicative data 
entry for reuse outside the immediate clinical context, or 
manual data tabulation for aggregate reporting. This clerical 
burden takes valuable time away from service provision, in 
the face of a health workforce shortage (11), reducing quality 
of care with care pathways that may be disjointed rather 
than integrated. For example, health service users who have 
missed services or appointments are difficult to identify in 
a timely fashion, limiting opportunities for real-time, data-
driven decision-making (12). Additionally, paper-based 
systems are associated with lack of quality control due to 
communication gaps, language barriers and misplacement of 
documents. Such systems not only prevent ease of access to 
health data by health service users themselves but also lead 
to missed opportunities for health service provision and care 
coordination, as well as self-care and continuity of treatment 
at home.
If digital systems already exist, they are often designed to 
facilitate data collection and reporting of aggregated data, 
rather than to provide important feedback at the point at 
which health services are provided (i.e. the point of care) to 
improve the quality of individual-level care. Poorly designed 
“data collection for data’s sake” digital systems result in 
similar burdens on the health system to those caused by 
paper-based systems. 
Well-designed PCPOSSs can play a critical role in ensuring 
quality health care, and in strengthening the overall resilience 
of health systems, especially in this post-pandemic period. 
There is currently an opportunity to strengthen the quality of 
service delivery and reinforce health worker performance by 
using the data generated at the point of care, made available 
by these PCPOSSs.

A person-centred point of service system (PCPOSS) is one 
in which health service users are served by and are able to 
participate in trusted health systems that respond to their 
needs in humane and holistic ways (13). It is used by health 
workers at the point of care (i.e. point of service) to create 
a persistent person-centric record of health events, across 
one or more health domains, encounters and health services 
received, allowing for longitudinal tracking of health service 
users, and it links to clinical decision support systems to allow 
for follow-up and reinforce good standards of practice. 
A PCPOSS also links to reporting and management tools to 
reinforce accountability. End-users of a PCPOSS can include 
all health worker occupational groups operating at all care 
levels, including those operating outside of formal health-
care facilities (e.g. community health workers and health 
volunteers). It should be noted that community-based 
information systems, decision support systems, electronic 
health record systems and personal health records may 
exist separately. However, the focus of this handbook is on a 
combined PCPOSS.
Based on the principle of “collect once, use for many 
purposes” (14), a PCPOSS that uses interoperability standards 
facilitates the collection and use of more reliable source data 
to feed in to aggregate indicators at management levels by 
providing access to primary data collected directly at the point 
of care, allowing a shift away from the need for aggregate 
indicators to be reported separately and for investments in 
paper-based or siloed digital indicator reporting systems 
(Fig. 4). Data collected for the purpose of service delivery can 
also be used to calculate aggregate indicators required for 
reporting and accountability, including monitoring provider, 
stock and system performance. Factors affecting overall health 
system performance can thus be highlighted more promptly 
and accurately while reducing the clerical burden on health 
workers. 
Achieving person-centred primary health care (PHC) is 
predicated on the establishment of a longitudinal record 
that enables an individual to have continuity of care across 
time, facilities, providers and systems. This requires adoption 
and rigorous implementation of semantic classifications 
and terminology standards (e.g., ICD-11, SNOMED-GPS) 
and syntactic interoperability standards (e.g., HL7 FHIR) to 
ensure person-centric data representation. Approaches and 
systems that omit adoption of health-specific, person-centred, 
semantic and syntactic data representation standards in their 
pursuit of PHC digital transformation will accumulate technical 
debt. Consequently, they will fail to deliver sustainable data 
exchange and continuity of care across time, health domains, 
facilities, providers and systems (16,17).  WHO is software 
agnostic and does not provide recommendations on specific 
digital health tools, software or platforms.
