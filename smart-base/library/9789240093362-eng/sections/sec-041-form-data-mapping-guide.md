The following guide helps organize and map which data elements are collected from each paper form currently used. A 
spreadsheet should be created to document this information. Each data element should be noted in a in separate row in the 
spreadsheet. For each row, the following columns should be filled out. This initial form data mapping will help with streamlining 
data collection design in subsequent steps (see sections 3.4 and 3.5). 
Activity ID
Include the Activity ID under which that data element is collected. This should align with the Activity 
ID that is provided during form mapping (see Annex 7).
Form ID
The Form ID should be from the Form ID listed in the forms inventory spreadsheet (Annex 7). List the 
Form ID in which the data element appears. This is important to ensure that the design of the digital 
system has taken into account all the required paper forms and data elements in those paper forms.
Form data 
element label 
List the label of the data element as written in the original form (or translated as closely as possible). 
This will be key in keeping track of which data elements from the original paper forms are duplicated. 
Note that duplicate data fields could have been included purposely in multiple forms (e.g. health 
service user identifiers, such as name, date of birth, village) as a means to identify an individual health 
service user.
If a data element appears in multiple forms, possibly with varying data element labels, list them all 
here, separated by a semicolon (i.e. Form ID-Form data element label; Form ID-Form data element 
label).
Data element 
label
The label of the data element written in a way that end-users can easily understand (e.g. “education 
level”, “weight”, “height”, “reason(s) for coming into facility”). The data element label in this column 
is what will be used in the digital form as the digital register should not simply replace the paper 
registers, but it should also streamline processes and link duplicated data elements.
Description and 
definition
The description and definition of the data element, including any units that define the field (e.g. 
weight in kilograms [kg]). Provide a clear explanation of what this data field is requesting.
This definition will be key for streamlining for resolving duplicate data elements and how required 
calculations are documented. Although the Data element labels could vary across paper forms, it is 
important to clearly note the definition of this specific data element as data elements with the same 
definition can be reconciled for one time data entry. Alternatively, it could also be discovered that 
data elements with the same Data element labels are used to mean different things. This would 
require a change in the data element labels so that data entry is done accurately. 
Data type
The data types are: 2
•	 Boolean (i.e. true/false, yes/no)
•	 String (i.e. a sequence of Unicode characters – e.g. name)
•	 Date (e.g. date of birth) – used when only the date is recorded
•	 Time (e.g. time of delivery) – used when only the time is recorded
•	 DateTime (e.g. appointment) – used when the date and time are recorded
•	 ID (e.g. unique identifier assigned to the health service user)

Data type 
(cont’d)
•	 Quantity – a number that is associated with a unit of measure outlined in the standard for Unified 
Code for Units of Measure (UCUM); quantities include any number that is associated with a unit, 
such as “number of past pregnancies”, where “past pregnancies” is the unit of measure   (if the data 
type is a Quantity there should be an associated sub-type listed in the Quantity sub-type column)
•	 Signature (e.g. supervisor’s approval) – an electronic representation of a signature that is either 
cryptographic or a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process
•	 Attachment (e.g. image) – additional data content defined in other formats
•	 List - select one (e.g. HIV status) – indicates a data element where only one value can be chosen 
from a corresponding list. The data elements in the corresponding list consist of “List value” data 
types. For example, “HIV status” is List - select one , and the corresponding list would include “HIV-
Positive”, “HIV-Negative”, “HIV status unknown”, all of which would have List value as their data 
type.
•	 List - select all that apply (e.g. symptoms) – indicates a list of data elements where more than 
one value can be chosen from a corresponding list. The data elements in the corresponding 
list are “List value” data types. For example, “Symptoms” is List - select all that apply , and the 
corresponding list would include “Headache”, “Fever”, “Bleeding”, all of which would have List 
value as their data type.
•	 List value (e.g. pregnant, HIV-positive, combined pill) – data elements that are values for “List - 
select one” or “List - select all that apply” data element types.
List to include 
this data 
element in
If the data element has a List value data type, this field indicates which data element of “List - select 
one” or “List - select all that apply” data types they correspond with. For example, HIV-Positive would 
correspond to HIV status.
Quantity 
subtype
Quantity data types can include any number that is associated with a unit of measure. However, there 
are many subtypes of the Quantity data type that should be listed here:
•	 Integer quantity – a whole number (e.g. number of past pregnancies, pulse, systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure)
•	 Decimal quantity – rational numbers that have a decimal representation (e.g. exact weight in 
kilograms, exact height in centimetres, location coordinates, percentages, temperature)
•	 Duration – duration of time associated with time units (e.g. number of minutes, number of hours, 
number of days)
Calculation
If a calculation is needed to define the data element, write the formula here. Leave this column 
blank if no calculation is needed. Write the formula using standard mathematical symbols and the 
Data element label included in the formula (e.g. for the body mass index [BMI] calculation, “weight/
(height2)”).
Optionality
Note whether this field is:
Required – R 
Optional – O
Conditional on answers from other data fields – C
Reason for 
requiring data 
If this field is required (R), state the reason here – whether for:
•	 accountability for global or national-level reporting
•	 service delivery or clinical decision-making
•	 health service user identification.

The PCPOSS should not simply replace paper registers, but should also streamline processes; thus, 
it is important to understand why a certain data field is required. Given the high volume of data 
collection required of health workers, it might be better to remove a data entry field if it serves no real 
purpose for the clinician, public health reporting, ongoing research studies or any other functional 
purpose.
Explain 
conditionality
If this field is conditional on answers from other data fields (C), denote what the conditionality is 
here. Conditionality helps to define the rules that govern the presence or absence of a data element 
based on certain criteria. This is common for data elements that are a part of follow-up questions. 
For example, if the input of one data element field is true, then some additional data inputs may be 
required.
Duplicates
If there is more than one Form ID and Form data element label listed in the previous column, then 
indicate “Yes” here. If not, indicate “No”.
All duplicated data elements should have the same “Data element name”. The PCPOSS should not 
simply replace paper systems, but it should also streamline processes and remove duplicated data 
entry. Indicating whether the data element is duplicated here will indicate which data elements need 
to be linked across forms. 
Functional 
grouping of 
data elements
This field is used to group data elements into a functional group depending on how they are used in 
decision-support tables and/or indicator definitions. For example, “Test sample type”, “Test sample 
collection date”, “Diagnostic test date”, “Diagnostic test type”, “Diagnostic test result date” can be 
grouped as “Lab tests” functional group.
Linkages to 
aggregate 
indicators
List the indicators here if this data element contributes to an aggregate indicator. If the data element 
does not contribute to calculation of an aggregate indicator, leave this column blank.
If the data element does not contribute to an aggregate indicator and is not needed for service 
delivery, consider removing it as a data field when designing the PCPOSS. This would reduce the 
burden of data collection for health workers. 
Linkages 
to decision 
support tables
List the decision support tables here if this data element contributes to decision logic.
If it does not contribute to decision logic, and it is not needed for service delivery, consider removing 
it as a data field when designing the PCPOSS. This would reduce the burden of data collection for 
health workers.
Linkages to 
scheduling 
logic tables
List the scheduling logic tables here if this data element contributes to scheduling logic.
If it does not contribute to scheduling logic, and it is not needed for service delivery, consider 
removing it as a data field when designing the PCPOSS. This would reduce the burden of data 
collection for health workers
Orphaned 
record
If this data element requires a calculation that is dependent on other data elements but those primary 
data elements are not being collected, then this data element is considered “orphaned”. Indicate Yes 
or No if this data element is orphaned.
Notes
If there is an issue or inconsistency in how a data element is defined, make a note of the issue here. 
Irregularities and inconsistencies will need to be resolved at a later stage through a process of team 
discussion and triangulation. This column should also be used for any other notes, annotations, or 
communication messages within the team. 
Mapping(s) to 
standardized 
classifications 
and 
terminologies
A column should be added to each classification or terminology code system (e.g. ICD-11, SNOMED-
GPS, LOINC) the PCPOSS is planned to use and interoperate with.  The code used for each data 
element should be logged in these columns. This is a highly resource-intensive, but necessary, 
task. Any existing standardized code systems that can be used, should be used for the purposes of 
interoperability so data can be exchanged with any other critical health information systems (e.g. lab 
systems, supply chain systems). This part can also be done through a terminology service.

Mapping 
comments and 
considerations
Any comments and considerations related to the mapping of data elements to standardized 
classification and terminology code systems should be noted here.
Mapping 
Relationship4 
For each classification and terminology code system that a data element that can be mapped to, this 
column should be used to identify the relationship between the original intent of the data element 
(i.e. “source concept”) with the classification or terminology mapping available in the existing code 
systems (i.e. “target concept”). The field should indicate:
•	 Related to – The concepts are related to each other, but the exact relationship is not known.
•	 Equivalent – The definitions of the concepts mean the same thing.
•	 Source is narrower than target – The source concept is narrower in meaning than the target 
concept.
•	 Source is broader than target – The source concept is broader in meaning than the target 
concept.
