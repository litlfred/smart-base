 * The prose of smart-kg's graph shape, carried VERBATIM from

 * (main, 66a9b13), keyed by the JSON Pointer it sat at. `graph.ts` attaches

It cannot check that a node's type is a class the ontology declares, nor that an edge is a triple the ontology licenses, because both live in ontology/l1.json rather than in this file; that is tier 2, and tools/validate.mjs is the reference implementation. A document passing this schema and failing that check is a well-formed graph of things the model does not say.",
  "/properties/@context": "The context published beside this schema, by URL or inline. A graph carrying its own ad-hoc context is not interoperable with the rest of the WHO linked-data estate, which is the point of having one.",

  "/properties/wasDerivedFrom": "The DAK sources this graph was extracted from, each pinned by hash. Same doctrine as the audit sidecar: edit a source and everything derived from it goes stale on its own rather than quietly disagreeing.",
  "/properties/dak": "The DAK envelope itself — the fields of the smart-base DAK logical model. Kept out of nodes because it is the subject of the whole document rather than one thing in it.",
  "/$defs/classId": "An ontology class id -- \"recommendation\", \"terminology-code\". Membership is checked at tier 2 against ontology/l1.json; this only rules out ids that could never be one.",
  "/$defs/predicate": "A predicate name. Membership is checked at tier 2 against ontology/l1.json; this only rules out strings that could never be one. Deliberately not an enum: the predicate set belongs to the ontology and changes with it, so a list here would be a second copy that drifts.",
  "/$defs/derivation": "Identical to traceability-link.schema.json, deliberately. derived: mechanically produced, no choice involved. inferred: a rule that could reasonably have gone another way. decided: the source is silent and someone chose. Every node and edge in a graph is one of the three, and the third is the one a reviewer needs to find.",
