/**
 * The **DAK** content type — a repository that is a WHO SMART Guidelines
 * Digital Adaptation Kit.
 *
 * **This is a placeholder, and the placeholder is the point.** A repo declares
 * itself a DAK by carrying {@link DAK_MARKER_FILENAME} at its root, exactly as
 * it declares itself a harness instance by carrying `harness.json`. That
 * much is settled and is modelled here. What is *not* settled is the shape of
 * the ten components inside it (nine in WHO's model, plus scheduling logic —
 * see `DAK_UNFORMALIZED_COMPONENTS`): WHO's `DAK` Logical Model is still being
 * finalised in FHIR upstream, so this module **records the components without
 * inventing their contents**.
 *
 * ## Why a placeholder rather than waiting
 *
 * Because the marker is what a consumer needs first, and it does not depend on
 * the model. "Is this repository a DAK, and where does it publish?" is
 * answerable today; "what is inside `healthInterventions[0]`?" is not. Blocking
 * the first on the second would leave the type unrepresented for however long
 * the LM takes, and a type nothing can name is a type nothing can scan for.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT model
 *
 * **The element shape of a component.** Each of WHO's nine is declared
 * `0..* <Name>Source` in `smart-base`'s `input/fsh/models/DAK.fsh`. The
 * **cardinality is final** — an array, possibly empty — so that much is
 * enforced. The **element** is not, so it is `unknown` and is carried through
 * untouched. Guessing it would produce a second, weaker, drifting copy of a
 * specification that is about to exist, which is the argument
 * `schemas/dak-blocks.ts` already makes about `ValueSet.compose.include`.
 *
 * **Anything else a real `dak.config.json` carries.** The schema is
 * {@link DakDeclarationSchema | passthrough}: unknown keys survive a
 * parse-and-write round trip. A placeholder that silently dropped the fields it
 * had not learned about yet would be worse than no placeholder — it would
 * destroy data from a real DAK on the first tool that read and rewrote one.
 *
 * ## Where the component vocabulary lives
 *
 * `smart-base/schemas/dak-kinds.ts` (core's `block-kinds.ts` until bean
 * `1335`), not here: {@link DAK_COMPONENTS} names the ten,
 * {@link DAK_COMPONENT_FIELDS} maps each to its field in WHO's own model, and
 * `smart-base/schemas/dak-blocks.test.ts` checks those names against a real
 * `DAK.fsh` when a `smart-base` checkout is present — reporting `n/a`, never a
 * pass, when it is not. This module builds its shape **from** that table rather
 * than restating it, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * @module schemas/dak
 * @graphNode schema

/**
 * The file whose presence at a repository root declares it a DAK.
 *
 * Fixed, not stub-named, for the same reason `harness.json` is: a consumer
 * bootstrapping into a repository it knows nothing about needs one filename to
 * open first. See `skills/kg/kg-core/directory-conventions.md` §Naming.
 *
 * ## `dak.config.json` → `dak.config.json`, 2026-09-22
 *
 * The owner's ruling, for consistency with `<name>.config.json`: a DAK
 * repository carries configuration, and this is that file, so it is spelled
 * like every other config here rather than like a bare declaration.
 *
 * **It was renameable because the type is OURS** — bean `cz17` settled that,
 * against an earlier note in `79t3` that listed it beside `sushi-config.yaml`
 * as somebody else's file. `sushi-config.yaml` is still not ours; this is.
 *
 * ## The upstream gap, stated rather than discovered
 *
 * `WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base` writes and reads **`dak.config.json`**:
 * `generate_dak_from_sushi.py` writes it, and `ghbuild.yml` gates the whole
 * DAK phase on its presence. Nothing upstream has been renamed, deliberately —
 * this is pre-work in `litlfred/*` only.
 *
 * So until upstream follows, {@link readDak} pointed at a real WHO DAK finds
 * **nothing**. That is a known divergence, not a bug to work around by
 * accepting both spellings: accepting both would make "this repo has migrated"
 * and "this repo has not" indistinguishable, which is exactly the state the
 * rename exists to end.
