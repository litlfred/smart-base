/**
 * The `dak` adapter's vocabulary — its block kinds, their builder names and
 * label prefixes, and the WHO DAK components they represent.
 *
 * These tables lived in core's `cat-harness/schemas/block-kinds.ts` until bean
 * `1335` (stage D of the smart-* separation, #1767). Core's content model named
 * the `dak` adapter, so `dak-blocks.ts` could not leave for smart-base without
 * core importing a harness. They reach core now the other way round: smart-base
 * CONTRIBUTES the adapter and its kinds as nodes — `content-adapters/dak.json`
 * and `block-kinds/` (bean riit, steps 3 and 5) — which `loadContributions`
 * registers through a folio's dependency tree, and core reads them from a
 * `ContributionRegistry` rather than from a module constant. See
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/dak-kinds-contribution-2026-10-02.md`.
 *
 * Since bean riit, step 3, the kinds and their builder, prefix and RDF types are
 * `folio-block-kind/v1` nodes in `smart-base/block-kinds/`, read here, and
 * `loadContributions` registers them for a folio whose dependency tree
 * includes smart-base. A leaf module, importing only the node schema and the
 * directory scan (and `dak-blocks.ts` for a TYPE), for the same reason
 * `block-kinds.ts` is one: `dak-blocks.ts` builds Zod schemas from these at
 * module initialisation, which is exactly when an import cycle bites.

// ── WHO DAK components, and this repo's coverage of them ─────────

/**
 * The WHO SMART Guidelines DAK components, in WHO's own order.
 *
 * The canonical list is eight components as published, plus **test scenarios**,
 * added later. Four WHO-side sources state it and they do not all agree, so the
 * list is pinned here rather than recited:
 *
 * | Source | Says |
 * |---|---|
 * | `smart-base` `input/fsh/models/DAK.fsh` | These nine, ending `testScenarios` — its own description says "all 9 DAK components" |
 * | `smart-ig-starter-kit` `l2_dak_authoring.md`, **the table** | These nine, identically numbered |
 * | `smart-ig-starter-kit` `l2_dak_authoring.md`, **the intro prose** | A different nine: scheduling logic promoted to #7, test scenarios absent — stale, and contradicted by the table directly beneath it |
 * | `sgex` `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Eight (predates test scenarios), *plus* a second list of artefact types that is not the components at all |
 *
 * Three of the four agree, including both machine-readable ones — but the
 * owner ruled, 2026-09-30, that the DAK has **ten**: the original eight, plus
 * scheduling logic and test scenarios (issue #1614). Scheduling logic is
 * authored as DMN decision tables but is not yet formalized as its own L2
 * logical-model field or L3 artefact, so it is listed here AND named in
 * {@link DAK_UNFORMALIZED_COMPONENTS}; the other nine match `DAK.fsh`
 * field for field. Anything counting components against one source alone is
 * off by one, silently.
 *
 * Published guidance:
 * - <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240099456>
 * - <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240085138>
 * - <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020306>
 *
 * This exists to make coverage answerable rather than assumed:
 * {@link DAK_COMPONENT_KINDS} maps each component to the block kinds that
 * represent it, and a component mapping to none is a documented gap, not an
 * oversight nobody noticed.

 *   decision tables, even though no L2/L3 artefact formalizes it yet.
 * - `core-data-elements` collects everything describing a variable's shape,
 *   including the L3 `structure-map` that transforms between two of them.

 * Coverage is asserted by test: every kind lands in exactly one component, and

 * no kind at all. `dakComponentsWithoutL2` reports the sharper gap: components
