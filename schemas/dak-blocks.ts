/**
 * WHO SMART Guidelines content blocks — the `dak` adapter.
 *
 * A DAK block is the same *shape* of thing as a paper block: a `.ts` manifest
 * with a label, editorial `uses[]` edges, and companion files, carrying a
 * `<stem>.qa.json` sidecar. What differs is which companion holds the
 * substance — a `.dmn` decision table rather than a `.lean` proof — and which
 * QA axes apply.
 *
 * Kept in its own module rather than added to `types.ts` because the adapter
 * separation is the point: `Block` stays the paper union with its
 * exhaustiveness proof against `BLOCK_KINDS`, and `DakBlock` gets its own
 * against `DAK_BLOCK_KINDS`. Mixing them would put every math axis one
 * `appliesTo` omission away from running on a ValueSet.
 *
 * ## What these types deliberately do NOT model
 *
 * Field-level semantics. A `value-set` block here carries a label, a title and
 * a pointer to its `.fsh`; it does not model FHIR's `ValueSet.compose.include`
 * or a DMN hit policy. Those belong to the artefact formats, which already
 * have specifications and validators (`fhir-validation`, `dmn-authoring`), and
 * inventing a parallel set of fields would create a second, weaker, drifting
 * copy — the same argument §2c of the ingestion proposal makes against
 * pointing a RAG engine at `content/`.
 *
 * The block manifest's job is identity, editorial edges and QA attachment. The
 * companion file is the content.
 *
 * ## Why this is in smart-base
 *
 * It was core's `cat-harness/schemas/dak-blocks.ts`, re-exported from core's
 * barrel, until bean `1335`. Core's content model named the `dak` adapter, so
 * the module could not leave without core importing a harness. It left once
 * the adapter and its kinds became a CONTRIBUTION (nodes in `content-adapters/`
 * and `block-kinds/` since bean riit; a `contributions.ts` before)
 * — core reads them from a `ContributionRegistry` now, and nothing in core
 * imports this file.
 *
 * @module smart-base/schemas/dak-blocks
