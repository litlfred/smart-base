 * The WHO logical model each DAK kind corresponds to, as a canonical IRI.
 *
 * WHO's IG publisher post-processes `smart-base`'s logical models into JSON
 * Schema and JSON-LD. Inspecting `generate_logical_model_schemas.py`, the
 * generated `@type` is a plain string carrying only an *example*
 * (`LogicalModel-HealthInterventions`), while `resourceDefinition` is a `const`
 * pinned to the StructureDefinition's canonical URL. **The canonical URL is the
 * stable identifier**, and it is the same one `DAKComponentSources.fsh` uses as
 * `canonical ^type[0].targetProfile`.
 *
 * So a block keeps its `folio-assistant-core:` `@type` — it is a manifest, not a FHIR resource
 * — and gains this as a separate assertion: *the thing this block is an
 * authored instance of*. That makes a folio DAK joinable with WHO's published
 * vocabularies instead of merely parallel to them.
 *
 * Deliberately **partial**. Ten of WHO's logical models name a component; kinds
 * without one — the L3 FHIR artefacts, and `scheduling-logic`, which WHO's model
 * still folds into decision support (the owner counts it as its own component;
 * see `DAK_UNFORMALIZED_COMPONENTS`) — get no entry rather than a fabricated IRI. An
 * unverified IRI never goes in a published graph.
