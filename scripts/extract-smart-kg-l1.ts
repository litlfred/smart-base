/**
 * One ingested library entry → one smart-kg L1 graph document:
 * `publication` → `publication-section` → `recommendation`. Bean `8pzh`.
 *
 * smart-kg's README says *"no PDF extractor, so publication and recommendation
 * nodes must currently be authored by hand"*. The ingest pipeline already
 * holds what such an extractor needs — the sections, their pages and their
 * text — so this reads a library entry rather than the PDF.
 *
 * ## What is READ, and what is never inferred
 *
 * smart-kg `docs/SCOPE.md`: *"a paraphrased recommendation is a different
 * recommendation"*. So:
 *
 * - a recommendation is found only by its PRINTED label (`Recommendation 8:`),
 *   never by prose that mentions recommending something. Those mentions are
 *   counted and reported, never emitted;
 * - its `statement` is the text after the label up to the first terminator
 *   (blank line, a wholly parenthesised line, a `Source:` line, the next
 *   label). Line breaks are joined with one space and NOTHING else changes —
 *   no de-hyphenation, no re-casing. A block with no terminator within
 *   {@link MAX_STATEMENT_LINES} lines is refused rather than cut at a guess;
 * - GRADE `strength` and `certainty` are set only when a GRADE phrase is in
 *   that same block, and the phrase is then a substring of `evidence.quote`.
 *   Anything else — including WHO's own non-GRADE categories such as
 *   *"(Recommended only in specific contexts or conditions)"* — is left
 *   unset, and the node's `note` quotes what the source said instead;
 * - a source attribution under a recommendation (`Source: WHO, 2019 (2).`) is
 *   quoted in the note and never resolved. It is not a `citation` node: the
 *   L1 ontology licenses no edge from a recommendation or a section to a
 *   citation, and an edgeless citation would be a node nothing can reach.
 *
 * Every recommendation is `inferred` — SCOPE: *"extraction from prose is
 * inferred at minimum, never derived"* — so each carries a note and evidence.
 *
 * ## Where the document goes
 *
 * BESIDE the entry, as `smart-kg-l1.json` (owner default, bean `8pzh`, after
 * the storage question went unanswered). smart-kg `STORAGE.md` would publish
 * an A-Box with its source and not commit it; here the source IS the entry, so
 * the document travels with it and `--check` is what keeps the copy honest.
 * Nothing is written into smart-kg.
 *
 * `.json`, as smart-kg's own extractors and `validate.mjs` name a graph
 * document, and NOT `.jsonld`: its `@context` is smart-kg's, by URL, and this
 * repository's JSON-LD corpus gates (`check-context-emission`) require every
 * `.jsonld` context to be readable offline. Holding smart-kg's context here
 * to satisfy them would be the copy bean `wg7r` refuses. Measured: as
 * `.jsonld` the document failed that gate with one unresolved context.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary is the pinned one
 *
 * Every class emitted must be in `who-smart-kg.terms.json` ({@link pinnedTerms});
 * the CLI refuses to write otherwise. The snapshot holds class ids only, so
 * predicates and per-class properties are checked by smart-kg's own
 * `tools/validate.mjs` — `--validate <checkout>` runs it, at the pinned commit.
 *
 *   bun run smart-base/scripts/extract-smart-kg-l1.ts --entry smart-base/library/<id> [--validate <smart-kg>]
 *   bun run smart-base/scripts/extract-smart-kg-l1.ts --check [--entry <dir>]
 *   bun run smart-base/scripts/extract-smart-kg-l1.ts --all    # rewrite every entry --check examines
