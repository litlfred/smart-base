/**
 * Slide 3 of the living deck (`cat-harness/content/docs/harnessed-kg-overview/`):
 * the ten DAK components, and the squares figure generated from them.
 *
 * Moved from `cat-harness/scripts/tests/harnessed-kg-overview.test.ts` in bean
 * `1335`, with the generator and the DAK vocabulary it reads. The claims are
 * unchanged; only who makes them moved. The page itself is cat-harness's, so
 * this test reads it there — the allowed direction, since smart-base needs
 * cat-harness.
